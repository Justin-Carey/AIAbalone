# 1. Champion eval function is the one already proven to be the best.
# 2. Challenger eval function is what is needed to be test, therefore,

#    we want it to be super better than the Champion one to replace it.
# 3. First, develop the Challenger function with experiments.
# 4. Second, do a lot of simulations to see the Challenger wins all the time.
# 5. Finally, if it does, promote the Challenger to the Champion,
#    by putting the contents of the Challenger to the Champion.
# 6. Start experimenting with a new Challenger, repeat the process.
