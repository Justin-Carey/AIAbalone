# <GUIDE TO MAKE THE EVALUATION FUNCTION INDIVIDUALLY>
#
# The evaluation function MUST have a very strict format, the signature of the pseudocode:
# int EvaluationFunction(BoardConfiguration board)
#
# It has to take a board configuration as input, and return the evaluated integer value.
# Only integer values are allowed to return because of the efficiency of the sorting later.
# Technically there is no range limit, but too big number slows the system down.
# The realistic range would be 0 to 10000, and you can't use any deduction or negative values.
#
# If you want to make some multiple evaluation functions, you have to add all scores up at the end.
# There are ways to do it, but one example should be:
#
# TotalEvaluationFunction = EvaluationFunction1 + EvaluationFunction2 + EvaluationFunction3
#
# So the final score would be evaluated from the individual functions.
# You can do whatever you want to do ONLY in this file, but the AI framework will call
# this get_evaluation_score function to evaluate the state, so do NOT change it.
#
# Input: State representation (Game board configuration).
# Output: Total evaluated score (Integer).
def get_evaluation_score(state):
    # Initialize the score.
    score = 0

    #TODO: Write your evaluation function(s) here.



    # Return the score evaluated.
    return score
